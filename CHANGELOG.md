# 2.0.0
##### 2020-Jan-15

* Updated:
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è  Build environment now requires Node 10 or greater.
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è  New approach to specifying locations introduces some breaking changes but shrinks the data significantly. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.  ([#298], [#291])
    * Resource files now use a `locationSet` property to make it easier to specify where the resources are included and excluded.
    * Removed: `countryCodes` properties
    * Removed: `featureId` properties and most `.geojson` files (everything that was just a country or a circular point is now gone, as it can be calculated)
    * This approach leverages code from [country-coder](https://github.com/rapideditor/country-coder) and [location-conflation](https://github.com/rapideditor/location-conflation) projects.
    * `dist/features.json` is now a FeatureCollection that only contains the _custom_ boundaries.
  * You can now view the community index data on a map at https://openstreetmap.community
