  "extendedDescription": "A group have been meeting since March 2011, initially in Nottingham, and, more recently in Derby, and from time to time elsewhere in the East Midlands. These are social gatherings, but are an excellent place to come and ask specific questions about OSM either in the area or in general. In the summer months we usually do some light mapping for an hour in the vicinity of our meeting place. The group as a whole has a special interest in mapping public rights of way and from time to time has mapping meetings for this purpose.",
