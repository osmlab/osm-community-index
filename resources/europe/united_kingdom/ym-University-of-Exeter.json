  "extendedDescription": "We are a team of enthusiastic Geographers with comprehensive knowledge of GIS. We are passionate about supporting the British Red Cross Society with various humanitarian aid efforts. We are also important teachers of the significance of mapping remotely sensed data and how this helps on the ground. Our mapathons have themed academic focuses that highlight the different GIS research in our geography department, while also functioning as employability awareness events which we use to invite speakers in to talk about their GIS/British Red Cross careers.",
